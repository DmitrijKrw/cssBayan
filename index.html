                Warsaw is the capital of Poland and the largest city in the country with a difficult history and destiny. 
                It is an interesting combination of antiquity and traditions, the modern rhythm of life and the energy of a large metropolis. 
                Warsaw is located in the central part of Poland and has a dramatic history. 
                Since the 16th century, when the city was chosen as the capital of the Polish state, it has been destroyed several times in the crucible of numerous wars. 
                The last of them, World War II, completely destroyed its heart - the Old City. 
                But Warsaw, like a phoenix, has risen from the ashes, albeit having lost, despite all efforts, part of its original historical appearance.
